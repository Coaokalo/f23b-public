| Method | Download |
| --- | --- |
| Copy and paste | [F-23B-v1.4.zip](https://github.com/Coaokalo/f23b-public/releases/latest/download/F-23B-v1.4.zip) |
| Installer | [F-23B-v1.4-Setup.exe](https://github.com/Coaokalo/f23b-public/releases/latest/download/F-23B-v1.4-Setup.exe), which does the same thing for you |

Both include the same aircraft, weapons, ten liveries and documentation.

**Manual install**

- Close DCS.
- Extract the ZIP and drag its contents into `Saved Games\DCS`.

**Manual upgrade**

- Close DCS and delete `Mods\aircraft\F-23B` and `Mods\aircraft\F-23B-Player` first.
- Copy the extracted contents into the same profile.

**Manual removal**

- Close DCS and delete those two aircraft folders.
- Delete the ten supplied `F23B-...` folders in `Liveries\F-23B` and, optionally, `F-23B-docs`.

**September 17/18 users:** run DCS Repair with **Check all files (slow)** once before your first manual upgrade.
Those releases changed stock game files. Copying a ZIP cannot restore them.
See [the exact steps and method switching](INSTALL.md).

For setup, close DCS, run the EXE, confirm both folders, then select **Install / Repair**.
Start an **F-23B Quick Start** mission. Your first flight uses the Langley livery and your Hornet controls.

## FAQ

**Do I need the Hornet?** Yes. It must be installed and activated. The download does not contain its proprietary files.

**What happens after a DCS update?** Installation remains available. If the connection cannot start, an in-game message says **connection OFF**.
Custom weapons, radar upgrades and SA 640 are then unavailable. Flight, the native cockpit and radar, bays, lights and liveries remain available.
Use [a compatible release](https://github.com/Coaokalo/f23b-public/releases/latest).

**Multiplayer or VR?** Single-player; VR and multiplayer not yet tested.

**Windows warns about the unsigned installer.** Use the ZIP.

**How do I remove it?** Delete the two aircraft folders and supplied liveries, or select **Remove** in setup.

**Where are the liveries?** Choose an `F-23B |` scheme in the mission editor or rearming menu. All ten are included.

## Limits and licences

The 336-mile kill is one supported flight, not a guaranteed launch range. Exact 350-mile shots remain unverified.
MALICE's coasting-apex estimate is not a hard altitude cap. Block II helmet cueing and post-launch datalink are not implemented.
AI uses the extended MALICE energy profile when the player also flies an F-23B.
See [known limitations](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).
